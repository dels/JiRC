Currently searching is supported only with a limited set parameters.

Any forks and extensions are very welcome!

## Why this project ##

The object of this project is to develop and provide an easy to understand 
and use Ruby library for the Jira Restful Interface. 

This is because the Jira web interface does not provide much functionality 
for a Scrum Master. Many metrics are difficult to generate and even more 
difficult to maintain. This Ruby lib should enable others to gather 
necessary data as need.

## Prerequisites and  Installation ##

This software has been tested with ruby 1.9.3 only.

Run bundler to install required gems.

## TODO ##

* add fields key (selects single fields to fetch)
* add order by date search parameter
